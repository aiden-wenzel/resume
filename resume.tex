\section{PROJECTS}

\subsection{Fractal Visualizer}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Utilized OpenGL APIs to accurately visualize the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets.
    \item Implemented custom panning and zoom functionality for near-infinite zooming into complex geometries.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conway's Game of Life}
\begin{itemize}
